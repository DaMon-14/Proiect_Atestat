-search function for admin searching clients usernames
-(verify other conditions of null check, especially User Add/Update)

-on entry creation use names(must be unique) for simplicity
-perfect Scanner_Course creation conditions
-verify actions on not login but want to access info
-add isactive to course table(if want to delete course set isactive to false so at attendance get suposed deleted course still appeares)
