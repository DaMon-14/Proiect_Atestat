~On profile page only admin should be able to edit fields(except password - can be changed by client)
-add posibility to change client username (beware of unique value)
-change password on client Profile page
-change api calls to exclude using the admin ones

-chenge Register button to reset password button
-on entry creation use names(must be unique) for simplicity
-perfect Scanner_Course creation conditions
-verify actions on not login but want to access info
-add isactive to course table(if want to delete course set isactive to false so at attendance get suposed deleted course still appeares)
-client id's not shown but required(on attendance create)-use usernames instead of id's or display Users id's




~verify corect text is displayed
~On Admin Clients shows only Non admin, by on get by course id shows admins also
~repair esp Api controller
~On dashboard get names not id's
~set phone number to string
~order by most recent on attendace getbycourseid
~revise api return methods (ie on user get do not return user password)
~remove delete client method
~implement verification condition on creates(ie client exists on entry creation)
 (admin client creation and entry done) 
~on getbyclient id page error on nonexistent client
~same for course
~remove course table field named institutionid
~make namespaces match folder
~remove salt field from User(automatically done by aspnet.identity)
~sort button on Cards page(default show only Active cards)




client shall not have access to id's
leave admin get methods to use id's not names
eventually make a tab to display names corelated to id's
